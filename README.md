# The mushroom image detector

This app is just a proof of concept (POC)!
The image classification model can be further optimized. The goal of the project was to develop a POC-model and deploy it on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)

## Introduction
- There are 9 folders of images of most common Northern European mushrooms genuses inside of the dataset. Each folder consist of 300 to 1500 selected images of mushrooms genuses. - The link to the dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images)

### Detectable Mushrooms
The image classifier can classify the following mushrooms:
- Agaricus = Champignons
- Amanita = Wulstlinge
- Boletus = Steinpilze
- Cortinarius = Schleierlinge
- Entoloma = Rötlinge
- Hygrocybe = Saftlinge
- Lactarius = Milchlinge
- Russula = Täublinge
- Suillus = Schmierröhrlinge
